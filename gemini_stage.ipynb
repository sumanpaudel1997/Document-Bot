      "\n",
      "* **Sphinx:** A powerful documentation generator that supports various extensions for Python documentation.\n",
      "* **mkdocstrings:** A lightweight and customizable extension that generates documentation directly from docstrings.\n",
      "* **sphinx-automodapi:** Automatically generates documentation for Python modules and functions.\n",
      "* **sphinxcontrib-autodoc-typehints:** Extends Sphinx to support type hints in documentation generation.\n",
      "* **sphinx-apidoc:** Generates documentation from source code without requiring docstrings.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Usage:**\n",
      "\n",
      "To use these extensions, install them in your Python environment and then configure them in your Sphinx configuration file (`conf.py`):\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc', 'sphinx_automodapi.automodapi']\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "**Explanation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "These extensions work by introspecting the Python code and generating documentation based on docstrings, type hints, and other metadata. They follow the conventions of the Python documentation style to create well-organized and informative documentation:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Module Documentation:** Sphinx and other extensions can generate documentation for individual Python modules, including a description, functions, classes, and attributes.\n",
      "* **Function Documentation:** Extensions like mkdocstrings extract documentation from function docstrings, including parameters, return values, and examples.\n",
      "* **Type Hinting:** Extensions such as sphinxcontrib-autodoc-typehints integrate type hints into the documentation, providing additional information about function signatures and return values.\n",
      "* **Automatic Documentation:** sphinx-apidoc can automatically generate documentation without requiring docstrings. It parses source code and infers documentation from code annotations and comments.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Benefits:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Improved Readability and Understanding:** Well-documented code makes it easier for others to understand and use your functions.\n",
      "* **Enhanced Code Maintenance:** Documentation helps maintain code consistency and reduces the need for additional comments.\n",
      "* **Developer Productivity:** Extensions like mkdocstrings and sphinx-automodapi can significantly speed up documentation creation, freeing up developers for other tasks.\n",
      "* **API Compatibility:** By following Python documentation conventions, your documentation can be easily integrated with other API documentation tools and libraries.\n"

It\\'s important to understand that it\\'s okay to feel anger, but it\\'s not okay to act on it in a harmful way.\\n\\n**Causes of Anger**\\n\\nAnger can be caused by many factors, including:\\n\\n* Feeling threatened or attacked\\n* Frustration or disappointment\\n* Injustice or unfairness\\n* Feeling overwhelmed or stressed\\n\\n**Managing Anger**\\n\\nThere are healthy ways to manage anger, such as:\\n\\n* **Taking a break:** Step away from the situation and give yourself some time to calm down.\\n* **Expressing your feelings:** Talk to someone you trust about what you\\'re feeling. Writing or drawing can also be helpful in expressing your anger.\\n* **Exercising:** Physical activity can help release pent-up energy and reduce stress.\\n* **Mindfulness:** Pay attention to your thoughts and emotions without judgment. This can help you better understand your triggers and develop coping mechanisms.\\n* **Cognitive restructuring:** Challenge the negative thoughts that are fueling your anger. Replace them with more positive or realistic ones.\\n* **Learning relaxation techniques:** Deep breathing, meditation, or yoga can help you calm down and reduce stress.\\n\\n**Avoiding Unhealthy Ways to Express Anger**\\n\\nIt\\'s important to avoid expressing anger in unhealthy ways, such as:\\n\\n* **Violence:** Never use violence to express anger. It\\'s dangerous and illegal.\\n* **Verbal abuse:** Screaming, cursing, or insulting others only makes the situation worse.\\n* **Passive-aggressive behavior:** Indirectly expressing anger through sarcasm, manipulation, or avoidance can damage relationships.\\n\\n**Seeking Help**\\n\\nIf you\\'re struggling to manage your anger, consider seeking professional help. A therapist can help you understand the cause of your anger, develop coping mechanisms, and improve your relationships.\"\n",
